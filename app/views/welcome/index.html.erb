<h1>Rails Simian Gym</h1>
<p>This application is a simple way to exercise the <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/SimianArmy">Simian Army</a>.
  The idea is to create a environment in which these tools can be understood and tinkered with so lessons can be
  comfortably taken to production apps. In particular:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The Gym takes a lot of resources every request, so it often needs to autoscale. This gives Chaos Monkey a chance to kill many instances.</li>
  <li>The Gym generates a lot of garbage for the Janitor Monkey to pick up.</li>
  <li>The Gym deliberately changes launches non-compliant instances and other resources so the Conformity Monkey can complain.</li>
</ul>

<p>Analyzing the behavior of this application will hopefully provide you with insight into the functionality and configuration of the Simian Army.
  Additionally, the development environment of the gym itself reflects some best practices regarding devops and ruggedization *before* launch such
  as the use of tools like gauntlt and mitten and sslyze as part of the production procedures.
